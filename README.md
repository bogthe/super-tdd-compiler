# Understanding the Super Tiny Compiler
This is just a simple learning project to understand THE SUPER TINY COMPILER! With the added benefit of unit tests.

# Run tests
All tests are found inside the `tests` folder.

To run, choose one of the compiler components from below:
- `node tests\tokenizer.spec.js`
- `node tests\parser.spec.js`
- `node tests\traverser.spec.js`

Test arrangement is quite simple and uses [npm assert](https://www.npmjs.com/package/assert) 
I'm would like to add karma & jasmine support, sometime in the **future.**

## Test importance
I'm sure you would like to understand this compiler mombo-jumbo as fast as possible and then feel smart for the rest of the day!

So why not **try this:** take each compiler component and go through each test first! I believe it's a thorough and bite-sized approach to learning a fairly complex concept!

## Why should I care? V2.0
In this version I'll try and take a more TDD approach (a very light one). This may mean it will be easier for you to understand how the compiler works, step by step (test by test ;) ). 

However I believe you do have to go through the tiny-super-compiler code at least once before having a look here!

## Mi casa es su casa
Feel free to improve on the project however you see fit! You have my full trust :)!
