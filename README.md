# Understanding the Super Tiny Compiler
This is just a simple learning project to understand THE SUPER TINY COMPILER! With the added benefit of unit tests.

[Please check out the original here! NOW!](https://github.com/thejameskyle/the-super-tiny-compiler)

# Run tests
All tests are found inside the `tests` folder.

To run use `node tests\tokenizer.spec.js`

Test arrangement is quite simple and uses [npm assert](https://www.npmjs.com/package/assert) 
I'm would like to add karma & jasmine support, sometime in the **future.**

## Why should I care? V2.0
In this version I'll try and take a more TDD approach (a very light one). This may mean it will be easier for you to understand how the compiler works, step by step (test by test ;) ). 

However I believe you do have to go through the tiny-super-compiler code at least once before having a look here!

## Mi casa es su casa
Feel free to improve on the project however you see fit! You have my full trust :)!
